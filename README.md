# RESTful APIs in Nodejs (CRUD Operations) 🌐

This project demonstrates the implementation of four fundamental CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Node.js and Express.js. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn the basics of building RESTful APIs or an experienced developer seeking a reference for creating scalable APIs, this project has got you covered. 🚀

## Features

1. **Create (✨):** The 'Create' API allows you to add new data to the system. You can use it to insert records into the database, making it easy to store and manage information.

2. **Read (🔍):** The 'Read' API fetches data from the database. You can retrieve specific records, list all items, or apply filters to narrow down your search.

3. **Update (📝):** The 'Update' API enables you to modify existing records. You can use it to update the properties of a particular item in the database.

4. **Delete (🗑️):** The 'Delete' API is designed to remove records from the system. It's an essential part of maintaining data integrity.
